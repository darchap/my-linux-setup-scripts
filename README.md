# My Linux Setup Scripts

As I like to change every few months my Linux distro (distro-hopping), I made a few scripts with all the things I usually do on different distros.

Things like configuring repos, remove programs that I don't use and install my favourite ones. I also install and configure specific programs for my laptop (Lenovo T440p).
